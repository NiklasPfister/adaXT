# How to chose the n_jobs parameter of RandomForest
When creating a random forest you can supply the parameter n_jobs[Link to parameter]. As stated in the documentation this controls the number of processes used when fitting and predicting the random forest. In order to allow for the creation of a custom [criteria function](../../decision_tree/examples/creatingACriteria.md) without requiring that [GIL](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock) is released, we opted for multiprocessing instead of multithreading. We implemented parallelism using python's [multiprocessing library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html). This incurs a heavier overhead than multithreading, especially in the setup of the multiprocessing.

Thus there is a trade-off between the overhead introduced in setting up each new process versus the amount of work that each process gets to do. For a lower amount of trees or smaller datasets this often results in diminishing returns on the speedup gained from using more processors. Thus is is advisible to investigate the speedup gained when fitting and predicting using different numbers of processors.
