# How to chose the n_jobs parameter of RandomForrest
When creating a forrest you can supply the parameter n_jobs[Link to parameter]. As stated in the documentation this controls the number of processes used when fitting and predicting the Random Forrest. Because we allow creation of one's own [criteria function](../../decision_tree/examples/creatingACriteria.md), and we do not want to require that the [GIL](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock) is released in these, it is not feasible to do multithreading. We have therefore implemented parallelism using python's [multiprocessing library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html). This incurs a heavier overhead than multithreading, especially in the setup of the multiprocessing. 

Thus there is a trade-off between the overhead introduced in setting up each new process versus the amount of work that each process gets to do. For a lower amount of trees or smaller datasets this often results in diminishing returns on the speedup gained from using more processors. Thus is is advisible to investigate the speedup gained when fitting and predicting using different amount of processors.
