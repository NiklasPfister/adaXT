# Criteria Class

This is the class used to evaluate the quality of a split while
fitting a decision tree.

There are several default Criteria classes implemented in adaXT that
can be directly loaded. It is also possible to create a custom
criteria class, which is explained
[here](../user_guide/creatingCriteria.md).


Criteria classes can be loaded as follows:
```python
from adaXT.criteria import CRITERIA_NAME
```

A list of all available Criteria classes is given below.
