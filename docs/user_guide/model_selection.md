# Model Selection
To allow for model selection, adaXTs DecisionTree and RandomForest are both
compatible with scikit-learns [model
selection](https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/modules/grid_search.html#exhaustive-grid-search).
This allows for use with classes such as
[GridSearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html)
and
[Pipeline](https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html).
